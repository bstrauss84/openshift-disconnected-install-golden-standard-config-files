This repo holds my golden standard OpenShift disconnected install configs, organized by version. Each version folder contains config files that can be used as starting points for a typical disconnected, baremetal deployment, including imageset configs, agent configs, and install configs. These are tested, reusable starting points I've used for customer installs and internal demos. Feel free to fork, adapt, or contribute improvements.
